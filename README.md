# ConnectZero

This project is my own attempt at creating an AI, which uses monte-carlo tree search to play connect-4. This approach is an alternative to the minimax algorithm. My version uses only MCTS, but often times neural networks are also used to improve the evaluation of a position. MCTS has lately shown big success in games like Chess and Go, where Googles AlphaZero and other engines like LeelaChess have overtaken classical minimax ones.
